GreenChallenge is a basic social network platform for people who intend to pursue an eco-friendly lifestyle.

Users can commit to built-in challenges that represent green habits or create new challenges and share them with other users. Users can set the regularity of their commitments and generate daily to-do lists with their timely challenges. They can mark the challenges complete, submit their to-do lists, and collect points for the completed challenges. Users can set average daily point goals and ask for reports containing the results of a certain period.

In addition, users can join or create groups. Groups are organized around a cross-cutting issue or a geographical location. Groups have recommended challenges and forums where members can share posts with each other.
